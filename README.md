Shiny Login Example
===========

This is an example on how you can use authentification for your shiny-server application. 

The work is based on my own ideas for securing shiny server apps, the blog post from [Huidong Tian](http://withr.me/blog/2014/01/03/authentication-of-shiny-server-application-using-a-simple-method/), and the post from [Owe Jessen](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/shiny-discuss/prvkYqU1Z0Y).

It is recommended to use a https-connection for your app. A good and easy tutorial for shiny server and nginx with ssl can be found [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19934190/shiny-server-on-nginx-with-ssl).
